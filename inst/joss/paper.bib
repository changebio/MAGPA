abstract = {Summary: A web-based application has been designed from a genetic epidemiology point of view to analyze association studies. Main capabilities include descriptive analysis, test for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and linkage disequilibrium. Analysis of association is based on linear or logistic regression according to the response variable (quantitative or binary disease status, respectively). Analysis of single SNPs: multiple inheritance models (co-dominant, dominant, recessive, over-dominant and log-additive), and analysis of interactions (gene-gene or gene-environment). Analysis of multiple SNPs: haplotype frequency estimation, analysis of association of haplotypes with the response, including analysis of interactions. {\textcopyright} 2006 Oxford University Press.},

abstract = {Complex multivariate data structures are better understood by studying low-dimensional projections. For a joint study of two data sets, we may ask what type of low-dimensional projection helps in finding possible joint structures for the two samples. The canonical correlation analysis is a standard tool of multivariate statistical analysis for discovery and quantification of associations between two sets of variables.},

@article{Adler2003,
abstract = {RGL is a library of functions that offers three-dimensional, real-time visu- alization functionality to the R programming environment. It ameliorates a shortcoming in the current version of R (and most other statistical software packages), namely the inability to allow the user to conveniently generate interactive 3D graphics. Since 3D objects need to be projected on a 2D display, special navigation capabilities are needed to provide insight into 3D relationships. Features such as lighting, alpha blending, texture mapping and fog effects are used to en- hance the illusion of three-dimensionality. Additional desirable features for interactive data analysis in 3D are the ability to rotate objects, and to zoom in/out so as to examine details of an object, or alternatively, to view it from a distance. The goal of the project described here was to provide a “3D engine” with an API (Application Programming Interface) designed for R. It is implemented as a portable shared library (written in C++) that uses OpenGL. The syntax of the RGL commands has been based on that of the related and familiar standard R commands, thus ensuring that users familiar with the latter can quickly learn the usage of RGL. This paper outlines the capabilities of the of the RGL library and illustrates them using some typical statistical applications.},
